# FS Car HUD

Minimal speedometer with `ox_fuel` and ESX integration.

- Displays speed, fuel, gear, and HUD state only while the player is driving.
- Automatically hides fuel/gear for special models (e.g. bikes) and syncs fuel back to the server.
- Talks to the NUI (`html/`) for enter/exit animations.
