# FS Wiring Minigame

Drag-and-drop minigame for connecting wires, ideal for hacks or robberies.

- Predefined difficulties (`Config.WiringDifficulty`) control time limits, wire sets, and descriptions.
- Colour scheme, sounds, and UI are configured via `Config.WireColors` and `Config.GameSettings`.
- Locks player controls, sets NUI focus, and reports results back to the server.
