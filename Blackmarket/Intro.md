#### Modern blackmarket system with NPC dealers and a tablet interface.
- The dealer arrives at locations defined in `Config.SpawnLocations`, uses bodyguards, and can react by fleeing, robbing, or trading.
- The mobile tablet (`Config.Tablet`) opens an NUI app with the product list from `Config.Items`.
- Supports ESX and QBCore, `ox_target`/`qb-target`, `ox_inventory`/`qb-inventory`, and notifications via `fs_notify`, `okokNotify`, or a custom callback.
- All texts live in the `locales` folder and are selected via `Config.Locale`.
- NPC behaviour (weapons, animations, vehicles, blips, scams, police reactions) is configured in `Config.*`.
