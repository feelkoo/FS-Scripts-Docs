# FS Chat

Full replacement for the default /chat with a modern UI, IC/OOC commands, and permission handling.

- Custom NUI panel with extended history, sounds, proximity tiers, and 3D text above players.
- Supports ESX and QB, auto-detects admin groups, and integrates with target notifications.
- Extensive command set (me/do/try, anonymous, twitter, staff, job, ad, clearstatus, etc.) with cooldowns, fees, and job locks.
- Compatible with legacy `chat:addMessage` and `chatMessage` events (re-maps them into the new UI).
